# Block app

This is a simple Flutter application I built as a learning exercise.

## What I Learned

Through building this "Block app", I gained a foundational understanding of several key Flutter concepts:

* **Basic Layouting:**
    * **Columns:** I learned how to arrange widgets vertically using the `Column` widget.
    * **Rows:** I learned how to arrange widgets horizontally using the `Row` widget.
    * **Containers:** I explored the `Container` widget to add padding, margins, and basic styling to other widgets.

* **Flutter Inbuilt Widgets:** I started working with some of Flutter's built-in widgets to create UI elements.

* **Custom Widgets:**
    * I learned how to create my own custom widgets to encapsulate specific UI components.
    * **Props (Properties):** I understood how to pass data to my custom widgets using properties (parameters).
    * **Text Prop:** I created custom widgets that accepted and displayed different text based on a property.
    * **Image Prop:** I created custom widgets that could display different images by passing an image path as a property.
    * **Reusable Widgets:** I practiced creating widgets that could be reused in different parts of the app with different data passed through their properties.
